This repository documents my journey through Kaggle's Machine Learning courses. The first learning path provides an introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning, covering topics from data preprocessing to building and evaluating machine learning models. The next is a continuation focusing on more intermediate-level skills in Machine Learning, covering topics from handling missing data to data leakage and more. 

## About Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning

Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning learn path is a great starting point for beginners in the field of machine learning. It covers the following key topics:

- Data Preprocessing: Exploring and cleaning datasets to prepare them for machine learning models.
- Model Building: Learning about different types of machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, and more.
- Model Evaluation: Understanding how to assess the performance of machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## About Kaggle's Intermediate Machine Learning

Kaggle's Intermediate Machine Learning learning path is a continuation of Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning course and focuses on practical applications using Python's scikit-learn library.

The course covers essential concepts and techniques in intermediate-level machine learning, including but not limited to:

- Handling missing data and categorical variables.
- Gradient boosting and ensemble methods.
- Interpretability of machine learning models.

## Repository Contents
