This repository documents my journey through Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning learn path. The learn path provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning, covering topics from data preprocessing to building and evaluating machine learning models.

## About Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning

Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning learn path is a great starting point for beginners in the field of machine learning. It covers the following key topics:

- Data Preprocessing: Exploring and cleaning datasets to prepare them for machine learning models.
- Model Building: Learning about different types of machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, and more.
- Model Evaluation: Understanding how to assess the performance of machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains important concepts and solutions to exercise problems covered in the Introduction to Machine Learning course by Kaggle. Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic or exercise:

- [Exercise: Data Exploration](exercise-explore-your-data.ipynb)
- [Exercise: Training ML Model](exercise-your-first-machine-learning-model.ipynb)
- [Exercise: ML Model Validation](exercise-model-validation.ipynb)
- [Exercise: Underfitting or Overfitting/Tree-based model/ Comparing Different Tree Sizes](exercise-underfitting-and-overfitting.ipynb)
- [Exercise: Random Forest Model Training and Validation](exercise-random-forests.ipynb)
- [My First Kaggle Competition Submission](exercise-machine-learning-competitions.ipynb)

Feel free to explore the notebooks and solutions to gain insights into the practical implementation of the concepts covered in the course.
